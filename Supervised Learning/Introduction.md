# So, let's talk about Supervised Learning

I just don't know what to put here for now, but I'll for sure update this file as I discover more thing about this topic.

Anyway, I'm starting here mainly for 2 reasons:

* 1 - I had some IA classes in one of my semesters while at FURB (University in Blumenau - SC - Brazil). In those classes we started with supervised learning, so I think I have at least a good base. Let's see how it goes.
* 2 - Seeing the name, it seems to be the easiest one hehe.

STILL UPDATING
