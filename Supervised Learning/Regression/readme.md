# Progression, or Regression, I don't know, always misname it

Everytime I needed to save the file to send it to avaliation, I just putted "Linear Progression.py", "Multilinear Progression.py", "Polinomial Progression.py". Yeah, I do have some problems with that.

Anyway, let's start talking about the Regression. As long as I know, I made myself a simple way of understanding what is regression while at AI classes: "Oh, so it's just a way to make the computer find what's the function that makes a nice line that goes across all those nice points in that nice graph".

Well, it wasn't wrong (at least doesn't seem to be wrong until now), but it's a liiiittle harder than that, with those overfitting, underfitting, why is my jeans not fitting and all of that.

I'll start now making some code and try to explain it in the best way I can. At first I'll just do the way I did while at classes, cause I still have the files, so it should be easy to explain the way I leraned it, even though those are the first codes I did in python (don't overbully me for that, please).

Hope you enjoy this learning process and learn something out of it as well.
