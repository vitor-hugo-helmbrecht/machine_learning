# Progression, or Regression, I don't know, always misname it

Everityme I needed to save the file to send it to avaliation, I just putted "Linear Progression.py", "Multilinear Progression.py", "Polinomial Progression.py". Yeah, I do have some problems with that.

Anyway, let's start talking about the Regression. As long as I know, I made myself a simple way of understanding what is regression while at AI classes: "Oh, so it's just a way to make the computer find what's the function that makes a nice line that goes across all those nice points in that nice graph".

Well, it wasn't wrong (at least doesn't seem to be wrong until now), but it's a liiiittle harder than that, with those overfitting, underfitting, why is my jeans not fitting and all of that.

I'll start now making some code and try to explain it in the best way I can. At first I'll just do the way I did while at classes, cause I still have the files so it should be easy to explain the way I leraned it, even though those are the first codes I did in python (don't overbully me for that, please).

After I explain what I did and some of my thinking process (oh that will be funny), I'll try googling something else to see if i find anything different from what I learned in classes and if that'll help me in learning more. If I don't find anything interesting or that add for this repository in google, I just won't put it here.

Of course not everything I put in here will be from my AI classes, but I'll still do my commentaries on all of the code to make it simples to understand and make my thinking process clear. That always will help my own learning as well, so I recommend it to everyone.

This last part seems so good that I think I'll put it on the main README. Yeah, I'll do it.

Anyway, hope you enjoy this learning process and learn something out of it as well.
