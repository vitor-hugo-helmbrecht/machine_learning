# Data science &amp; Machine learning
Repository created to store all my studies about data science &amp; machine learning

Observation:
  * As I'm using this repository for learning, some content here are not completly from my authorship. Sources will always be provided. If I forget to do so, please let me now.

## Disclaimer
This repository is completely inspired from a repository of a friend of mine, [Victor Bona](https://github.com/vicotrbb). If you see the README.md file in both repositories, you'll notice they're pretty identical, because I just took it as a start point for my studies. If you're interested in this subject, I really recommend going on his repository and seeing how he's doing as well ([Victor's Machine Learning repository](https://github.com/vicotrbb/machine_learning)).

Even though this start is pretty much the same, I won't use his repository to make mine in any other step, it's just an inspiration to start my path on the data science &amp; machine learning road.

## Roadmap

My learning roadmap will be based on the following image.

Everytime I start or complete my studies of one of the topics, it'll be checked in the Milestones topic, as well as a whole new folder about that topic will be added in this repository.

## How I'll do it

It might seem a little cliche and "Oh, what a good guy he is", but it's just my way of learning (hope you enjoy it).

This repository is not just for me, I hope that people who want to learn machine learning can come here and absorb the things he/she wanted to learn at first.

Because of this, I'll always try to put every step of my thinking process (oh that will be funny) in the commentaries of the code to make it easiers to understand what's happening, cause I know that sometimes I can do pretty nice messy code. That always will help my own learning as well, so I recommend it to everyone.

Some of the thing I have in this repository will be based on what I learned in the university I went (FURB - University of Blumenau, SC, Brazil). If that's the case, I'll always try googling something else to see if I find anything different from what I already learned and if that'll help me learning more. If I don't find anything interesting or that will add cool things for this repository, I just won't put it here.

Anyway, hope you enjoy this learning process and learn something out of it as well.
