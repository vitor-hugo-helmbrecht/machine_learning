# Data science
Repository created to store all my studies about data science &amp; machine learning

Observation:

## Disclaimer
This repository is completely inspired from a repository of a friend of mine, Victor Bona. If you see the README.md file in both repositories, you'll notice they're pretty identical, because I just took it as a start point for my studies. If you're interested in this subject, I really recommend going on his repository and seeing how he's doing as well (https://github.com/vicotrbb/machine_learning).

Even though this start is pretty much the same, I won't use his repository to make mine in any other step, it's just an inspiration to start my path on the data science &amp; machine learning road.

## Roadmap

My learning roadmap will be based on the following image.
Everytime I start (- Ongoing) or complete my studies of one of the topics, it'll will be added to the Milestones, as well as a whole new folder about that topic will be added in this repository.
